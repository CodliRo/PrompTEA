# PrompTEA: A Prompt Optimization Framework for Language Models

## Overview

**PrompTEA** is an open-source framework designed to optimize prompts for language models. The framework uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate high-quality prompts that elicit specific responses from language models. By providing a powerful and customizable tool for prompt engineering, PrompTEA helps users improve the performance of language models across a wide variety of tasks.

## Features

- **Prompt Optimization**: PrompTEA uses a novel optimization algorithm to generate prompts tailored to a specific language model and task.
- **Language Model Support**: The framework supports a wide range of language models, including popular models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and more.
- **Customizable**: Users can customize the optimization process by specifying their own objectives, constraints, and evaluation metrics.
- **Easy to Use**: With a simple and intuitive API, PrompTEA integrates easily with existing NLP pipelines.
- **Extensive Documentation**: PrompTEA comes with detailed tutorials, examples, and API references to help you get started quickly.
- **Scalability**: PrompTEA is designed to be scalable and can handle large-scale tasks in production environments.

## Installation

To install PrompTEA, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CodliRo/PrompTEA.git
```

Ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed, and you're ready to start optimizing prompts with PrompTEA.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use PrompTEA to optimize a prompt for sentiment analysis:

```python
import prompTEA

# Define the language model and task
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
task_name = "sentiment-analysis"

# Define the prompt to optimize
prompt = "I love this product because"

# Optimize the prompt using PrompTEA
optimized_prompt = prompTEA.optimize_prompt(model_name, task_name, prompt)

print(optimized_prompt)
```
Here's an example of how to use PrompTEA in basic source:
In the file directory (`data/templates.json`), you can customize more prompt construction by using AI or you can optimze more by using my advices [Paper](https://dangnhutnguyen.github.io/Portfolio/#library)
```json
[   
    "Can you explain {prompt} in simple terms?",
    "How does {prompt} impact our daily lives?",
    "What are the benefits and drawbacks of {prompt}?",
    "Can you provide an example of {prompt} in action?",
    "How does {prompt} relate to {context}?",
    "What are the latest developments in {prompt} research?",
    "Can you compare and contrast {prompt} with {field}?",
    "How can {prompt} be used to improve {context}?",
    "What are the potential risks and challenges associated with {prompt}?"
    #you can customize more
]
```
Then , in the file directory (`main.py`), you can change your prompt in the (`original_prompt = "#your prompt here"`)
```python
from optimizers.prompt_optimizer import PromptOptimizer
def main():
    optimizer = PromptOptimizer()
    #input original prompt right here:
    original_prompt = "#your prompt here"
    result = optimizer.optimize_prompt(original_prompt)

    print(f"Original Prompt: {result['original']}")
    print(f"Original Score: {result['history'][0][1]:.3f}")
    print(f"Optimized Prompt: {result['optimized']}")
    print(f"Final Score: {result['history'][-1][1]:.3f}")
    print(f"Score Improvement: {result['score_improvement']:.3f}")

    print("\nOptimization History:")
    for prompt, score in result['history']:
        print(f"Score: {score:.3f} - {prompt}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
### Customization

PrompTEA provides the flexibility to customize the optimization process according to your specific needs. You can define objectives, constraints, and evaluation metrics to guide the optimization process. Here's an example:

```python
import prompTEA

# Define the language model and task
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
task_name = "sentiment-analysis"

# Define the prompt to optimize
prompt = "I love this product because"

# Define the customization options
customization_options = {
    "objective": "maximize",              # The optimization goal
    "constraint": "length <= 10",         # Constraint on prompt length
    "evaluation_metric": "accuracy"       # Evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score)
}

# Optimize the prompt using PrompTEA with customization options
optimized_prompt = prompTEA.optimize_prompt(model_name, task_name, prompt, customization_options)

print(optimized_prompt)
```
Yet, I've mentioned in Usage, you can customize templates in (`data/templates.json`), you can find more advanced templates by this one [Paper](https://dangnhutnguyen.github.io/Portfolio/#library)
### Available Customization Options:

- **Objective**: The goal of the optimization (e.g., maximize or minimize a specific metric).
- **Constraints**: Any restrictions or limits on the prompt (e.g., length, complexity).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The metrics to assess the effectiveness of the optimized prompt (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).
